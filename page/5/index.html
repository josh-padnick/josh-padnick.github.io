                            <p>When I was younger, I thought being a mega-successful entrepreneur like Richard Branson or Michael Dell was a matter of cleverness.  If you were just clever enough to figure out the right market opportunity, then you could make millions.</p>

<p>How wrong I was.</p>

<p>Take Richard Branson.  For his very first entrepreneurial undertaking — when he was still just a teenager — he purchased young Chrismas Trees, planted them during the spring, and then resold them at a profit during Christmas time in the winter.  I actually do think that’s pretty clever, especially for a kid.  But really that’s as far as “clever” alone will take you.</p>

                            <p>One of the things I really love about my life is I’ve met more entrepreneurs than I can count. One of the coolest things about entrepreneurs is that they seem to have zero demographics in common. In other words, I’ve met entrepreneurs…</p>

<ul>
<li>From both wealthy homes and poor homes</li>
<li>Of pretty much all ethnic backgrounds</li>
<li>From pretty much all educational backgrounds</li>
<li>Of pretty much all ages</li>
<li>In equal proportion from both sexes</li>
<li>Of course, as with any group, there are things in common. I guess “traits of an entrepreneur” is destined for another posting.</li>
</ul>

<p>This post is about a very important difference I’ve seen in all entrepreneurs, and here’s what it comes down to:</p>

                            <p>I recently stumbled upon <a href="http://www.rockstartup.com/">RockStartup.com</a>. It’s basically a documentary, split up into several episodes, that covers the birth of the website <a href="http://www.payperpost.com/">PayPerPost.com</a> by following around the CEO/Founder, Ted, and the PR person, Britt.</p>

<p>PayPerPost (”PPP”) is a weird concept — PPP pays bloggers to write content and sources content from Publishers, and then earns money by charging advertisers to put ads on PPP-sponsored blog sites. It’s been controversial because blogging’s rise to fame is due to its unbiased nature, and paying someone to blog, well, I guess it’s hard for them not to be biased.</p>

<p>But the success of PPP is another discussion. I’m more interested in the man behind PPP, Ted. Based on 10 minutes of watching RockStartup, I defnitely saw some “patterns” I’ve seen in other entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>When I was at Wharton as an undergrad, in my Senior year I took an Entrepreneurship course where you had to build some unique software, come up with a business plan, and then pitch it all to VC’s.</p>

<p>Our idea was terrible. We were going to build a system for people running political campaigns to help them get a sense of how people were planning on voting. We had a barcode-scanner-pen that scanned in a person’s survey responses, and then aggregated all the information so that a campaign director could see how people felt about a variety of issues.</p>

                            <p>There’s a strange phenomenon I’ve discovered in business and in life: I call them “Counter-Goals”.</p>

<p>So what’s a Counter-Goal? Well, it’s a goal which is achieved best by not pursuing it in the first place. Huh?</p>

<p>Okay, an example. When I was in my first year at Wharton Undergrad, I took a class called Management 100. The concept of the course was (and probably still is) quite novel. I was a member of a group of 12 other freshmen, and as a group we were tasked with completing some kind of major project. One group had to build a playground. Another group had to hold a major fundraising event. Our goal happened to be teaching the basics of economics to sixth graders.</p>

                            <p>I’ve never really thought of myself as a salesperson.</p>

<p>I remember when I was younger I interned for GE and they had some career fair at the end of the summer where you met people in all the different &ldquo;early talent identification&rdquo; programs. When I got to the sales people, they all just seemed so smooth. I didn’t trust them, and I certainly didn’t want to buy anything from them. I just couldn’t picture myself joining that table over some of the others.</p>

<p>Well, fast forward a few years after I started <a href="http://omedix.com">Omedix</a> and reality struck – I had inadvertently positioned myself as the sole salesperson for our company. Either I sold our product or we didn’t do business; it was that simple. And so I had to start learning how to sell.</p>
